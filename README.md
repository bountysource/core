If you want to make Bountysource.com better, you've come to the right place.

## Bountysource needs your help!

Bountysource is run by volunteers, so development activity can be sporadic (to put it nicely).

## Local Development Environment (Ubuntu)

### Ruby

First install ruby. In order to maintain different versions of ruby and switch between them install rbenv instead of following the official ruby guide.

```
sudo apt install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev nodejs yarn

```

A more in depth guide can be found on https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/16.04

### Rails

Official guide: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html

#### Troubleshoot

An error occurred while installing ovirt-engine-sdk (4.3.0), and Bundler cannot continue.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev

```

An error occurred while installing pg (0.18.4)

```
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

### Starting the app

WIP

In one terminal run (runs the app on localhost:3000)

```
rails server
```

and in the other

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

seed scripts

```
# basic migration setup
rake db:setup

# seeds from ./db/seeds.rb
rake db:seed
```

You can check the db contents by using Adminer on localhost:8086 (Or PgAdmin)

```
System: PostgreSQL
Server: pgsql
Username: bountysource
Password: password
```

## Generating a visual representation of the db

We're using railroady for this
https://github.com/preston/railroady

Run the app and the db and run:

```
rake diagram:all
```

The svgs are located in the doc folder.

## Caching

https://blog.appsignal.com/2018/04/17/rails-built-in-cache-stores.html#:~:text=To%20use%20Redis%20as%20a,it%20reaches%20its%20maximum%20size.

config/enviorments/production.rb

We should also check

tmp/cache - filesize on the server

## Local Development Environment (OS X)
```
# dependencies
brew install rbenv
brew install mysql
brew install postgresql

# checkout latest code
git clone git@github.com:bountysource/core.git bountysource-core
cd bountysource-core

# make sure you're running ruby 2.4.3 (if not, mess with rbenv)
ruby -v

# install Gemfile
gem install bundler
bundle install

# setup ENV
cp .env.dev .env
rake db:setup

# start server
./bin/rails s
open http://localhost:3000/
```

### Hostnames for local development
We need different hostnames, so by default we use these:
* http://localhost:3000/ - bountysource
* http://127.0.0.1:3000/ - salt
* http://0.0.0.0:3000/ - api

Alternatively, you can add entries to `/etc/hosts` and change the hostnames in your `.env` file:
```
127.0.0.1 www.bountysource.local api.bountysource.local salt.bountysource.local
```

### Running tests
```
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create
./bin/rake
```

## Local Development Environment with Docker (deprecated)

For self-hosting, you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

The following was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. It'll likely work very similar on other Linux distros.

First tip, don't bother with the Docker or Docker Compose packages that your distro provides (too old, superseded).

Simply install from upstream. To install Docker, do

```console
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

To run Docker without superuser rights (`sudo`):

```console
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then install Python virtualenv:

```console
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Create a new virtualenv and install Docker Compose into that:

```console
virtualenv ~/docker-compose
source ~/docker-compose/bin/activate
pip install docker-compose
```

Here are the versions I get:

```console
(cpy361_6) oberstet@thinkpad-t430s:~/scm/oberstet/bountysource_core$ docker --version
Docker version 17.05.0-ce, build 89658be
(cpy361_6) oberstet@thinkpad-t430s:~/scm/oberstet/bountysource_core$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.13.0, build 1719ceb
```

Now pull and build all required Docker images:

```console
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

Then start the Docker containers relevant for the service:

```console
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

This should start 3 Docker containers (Bountysource, PostgreSQL and Sphinx):

```console
(cpy361_6) oberstet@thinkpad-t430s:~/scm/oberstet/bountysource_core$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
04599623589b        bountysourcecore_bountysource   "rails s"                11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes       0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   bountysource
27157a0c1ec0        leodido/sphinxsearch:2.2.9      "searchd.sh"             11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes       9306/tcp, 9312/tcp       sphinx
45c0202dd08b        postgres                        "docker-entrypoint..."   11 minutes ago      Up 11 minutes       5432/tcp                 pgsql
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You should see the Bountysource start page, something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iAPoCf4.png).


### Running the unit tests

To run the unit tests:

```console
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f tasks.yml up test
```

You should see something like this in the end:

```console
(cpy361_6) oberstet@thinkpad-t430s:~/scm/3rdparty/bountysource_core$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f tasks.yml up test
Starting pgsql ...
Starting pgsql ... done
Starting sphinx ...
Starting sphinx ... done
Starting bountysourcecore_test_1 ...
Starting bountysourcecore_test_1 ... done
Attaching to bountysourcecore_test_1
test_1          |

.. lots of output (snipped) ..

test_1          | Finished in 2 minutes 48.5 seconds (files took 7.23 seconds to load)
test_1          | 1239 examples, 0 failures, 13 pending
test_1          |
bountysourcecore_test_1 exited with code 0
```
