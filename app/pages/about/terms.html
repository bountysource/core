<h2 class="text-center">Terms of Service</h2>

<p>THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT between you and BountySource Inc. ("<strong>Bountysource</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>"). By using the Bountysource.com website ("<strong>Site</strong>") or any of the Bountysource services ("<strong>Services</strong>"), you agree to all the terms and conditions of this Terms of Service ("<strong>Agreement</strong>"). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not proceed with the registration process or use our Site or Service.</p>

<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>Bountysource is a platform for encouraging development in open-source projects by bringing together users and developers to solve existing development issues.   In this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"<strong>Backers</strong>" are users that pay Bountysource to contribute to Fundraisers or Bounties.</li>
  <li>"<strong>Bounties</strong>" are cash rewards that Bountysource pays to Developers who first develop a successful Solution to an Issue.</li>
  <li>"<strong>Committers</strong>" are persons that are authorized to merge code into a Repository on behalf of an open-source project.</li>
  <li>"<strong>Developers</strong>" are users that try to develop Solutions and claim a Bounty, or who receive funds from Fundraisers for a particular goal.</li>
  <li>"<strong>Fundraisers</strong>" are fundraising campaigns for a particular defined goal. Any user can create a fundraiser for any purpose related to open source projects. There are two types:
    <ul>
      <li>"All or Nothing" Fundraisers (where the defined goal must be achieved before any cash is provided to the Developer).</li>
      <li>"Flexible" Fundraisers (where 90% of all cash pledged is provided to the Developer, regardless of whether the goal is met).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>"<strong>Issues</strong>" are features, bugs, development needs or other issues that are posted on Bountysource and are in need of an open source Solution.  Any User can define an Issue by posting the Issue on an issue tracking website such as GitHub or BitBucket.</li>
  <li>"<strong>Repositories</strong>" are the applicable open source project's code repository.  Bountysource does not act as a Repository for any Solutions or open source code.</li>
  <li>"<strong>Solutions</strong>" are an original creation by a Developer to try and solve a particular Issue on Bountysource.  Solutions are submitted to the applicable Repository and not directly to Bountysource. Persons authorized to accept and merge code will decide whether a Solution is accepted or not.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Bounties</h3>
<p>2.1 A Backer pays Bountysource to encourage the development of a successful Solution to an Issue.  Bountysource will then post the terms of the Bounty on the Bountysource.com website. Backers must provide their payment at the time they create a Bounty. Backers consent to Bountysource and its payments partners charging their payment card or other payment method for the amount of their payment. Bounties are nonrefundable and an additional 10% charge is added at the time of payment (a Backer will be charged $110 for $100 Bounty).</p>
<p>2.2 Backers may create more than one Bounty on an Issue. Once a Bounty has been created, Backers may not decrease or cancel it.</p>
<p>2.3 Bounties are nonrefundable.</p>
<p>2.5 Bountysource will pay Bounties to the first Developer whose Solution is accepted.  Bountysource reserves the right (but is not obligated) to apportion Bounties if multiple Developers present Solutions simultaneously or if a Developer submits a partial Solution.</p>
<p>2.6 Committers, Backers and Developers and other users should not take any action in reliance on having a successful Solution until the successful Solution has been accepted by a Committer.</p>
<p>2.7 Developers should not take any action in reliance on having a Bounty awarded until Bountysource notifies them that they have the ability to withdraw and spend the money.</p>
<p>2.8 Because of occasional failures of payments from Backers, Bountysource cannot guarantee the full receipt of the Bounty amount pledged minus fees.</p>
<p>2.9 Bountysource and its payments partners will remove their fees before transmitting proceeds of a Bounty to Developers.</p>
<p>2.10 Bountysource reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a Bounty at any time and for any reason. Bountysource is not liable for any damages as a result of any of those actions. Bountysource's policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.</p>
<p>2.11 By participating in our Service, you agree that Bountysource's good faith decisions will be final and not grounds for claims or litigation. Bountysource shall not be liable to you, and you hereby release us from any and all claims, for any damages resulting from or in connection with of any such determinations. Bountysource's policy is not to comment on the reasons for any of those actions.</p>
<p>2.12 <strong>Submitting Solutions</strong>. Developers are responsible for properly submitting their proposed Solutions to the appropriate Repositories. Bountysource does not receive, process or review proposed Solutions. If you are a Developer, you represent, warrant and promise that any Solution provided by you or on your behalf is an original creation of yours, was prepared in accordance with the applicable open source license, and does not (directly or indirectly) infringe the intellectual property rights or other legal rights of any third party.</p>
<p>2.13 <strong>Selection of Winning Solutions</strong>. The winning Solution will be selected by a Committer by merging code into their Repository. The first merged Solution wins the Bounty. You agree not to make claims against Bountysource or hold Bountysource responsible in connection with the determination of the winning Solution.</p>

<h3>3. Fundraisers</h3>
<p>3.1 <strong>Creation of Fundraisers</strong>. Any Bountysource user may initiate a Fundraiser, which is a financial goal to raise money for any open-source project, event or coding need. The user must provide all information requested by Bountysource, which will include (but not be limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fundraising goal (how much they wish to raise)</li>
  <li>Description of the project and purpose (why are they raising money)</li>
</ul>
<p>3.2 <strong>Posting of Fundraisers</strong>. Upon the user's successful establishment of the Fundraiser, Bountysource will post the Fundraiser and encourage Backers to make pledges. Bountysource is not responsible for reviewing and approving the content of Fundraisers.  However, Bountysource reserves the right to cancel, modify or reject Fundraisers at any time.</p>
<p>3.3 <strong>Types of Fundraisers</strong>. There are two types of Fundraisers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All-or-Nothing Fundraiser - Bountysource disburses funds if, and only if, the project's purpose has been met. If not, Bountysource returns 90% of funds to Backers.</li>
  <li>Flexible Fundraiser - Bountysource disburses 90% of funds as they are received, regardless of whether the project's purpose has been met.  Backer payments to Bountysource are nonrefundable.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.4 <strong>Rewards</strong>. Users that initiate a Fundraiser are encouraged (but not required) to give rewards to Backers who financially support the Fundraiser. Users are solely responsible for providing any rewards that they offer in a fair, reasonable and timely manner. Bountysource is not responsible and assumes no liability for provision of rewards (unless expressly agreed in a writing signed by Bountysource).</p>
<p>3.5 <strong>Use of Funds.</strong> Recipients of Fundraiser monies must apply all funds solely in ways that directly advance the stated project purpose. If requested by Bountysource, recipients must provide a complete and accurate accounting of the application of such funds. If Bountysource determines in good faith that funds have been misapplied or used contrary to the intent as expressed in this Agreement and in the applicable Bounty or Fundraiser posting, Bountysource may demand return of some or all of the funds, and recipients shall be obligated to repay such funds within three (3) business days of such demand.</p>

<h3>4. Registration</h3>
<p>4.1 <strong>Registration Information</strong>. Some users of our Service, such as Developers and Backers, must register with Bountysource. If you are required to register, you must provide accurate, complete and current registration information and promptly correct and update your information while you have an account with Bountysource. Your provision of inaccurate or unreliable information, your failure to promptly update information provided to Bountysource, or your failure to respond for over 7 calendar days to inquiries by Bountysource concerning the accuracy of contact details associated with your registration shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be a basis for termination of your account.</p>
<p>4.2 <strong>Screen Name and Project Names</strong>. You must not select a screen name or project name that (i) is the name of another person, with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) is subject to any rights of another person, without appropriate authorization; or (iii) is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene. Bountysource reserves the right in its sole discretion to refuse registration of or cancel a screen name or project name.</p>
<p>4.3 <strong>Account Activity</strong>. You are solely responsible for activity that occurs on your account and shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password for the Site.
