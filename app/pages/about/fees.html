<h1>Fees &amp; Payments</h1>

<h2>Fundraiser Fees</h2>
<h3>Bountysource Fee</h3>
<p>Bountysource collects a 10% non-refundable fee from all pledges.</p>
<p>If an all-or-nothing fundraiser's goal is not met, backers are refunded their pledged amount less the Bountysource fee.</p>

<h3>Payment Processing Fees</h3>
<p>Bountysource does not charge any payment processing fees. Payment processing costs are factored into our 10% fee.</p>

<h3>Merchandise Fees</h3>
<p>If a fundraiser creator chooses to have Bountysource fulfill merchandise, this cost will also be deducted from the funds raised. If you're considering a fundraiser and would like to have Bountysource create t-shirts, stickers, or other merchandise, <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>Bounty fees</h2>
<h3>Claiming a bounty</h3>
<p>We do not charge anything to claim a bounty. The amount displayed as the bounty total is the exact amount a developer will receive upon payout.</p>

<h3>Placing a bounty</h3>
<p>Bountysource charges a 10% non-refundable fee for placing bounties in addition to the specified bounty amount.</p>
<p>For example, to place a $1,000 bounty on an issue, you will be charged $1,100.</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>
<h3>Payout vs. Cashout</h3>
<p>A Payout is a transfer of money from Bountysource to a Bountysource account.</p>
<p>A Cashout is a withdrawal of your Bountysource balance. All cashouts are processed on a per-request basis. We can send you money via Paypal, Google Wallet, physical check, or bank wire. Bountysource is not responsible for any fees incurred due to the chosen cashout method.</p>
<p>To request a cashout of your current Bountysource balance, please <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>Bounty Payouts</h3>
<p>Bounties are automatically paid out to a developer's Bountysource account once their solution is accepted. You can request a cashout <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">via email</a>.</p>

<h3>Fundraiser Payouts</h3>
<b>Flexible Funding</b>
<p>Pledges are paid out to a developer's Bountysource account as soon as the fundraiser breaches its funding goal. If the fundraiser raises more than its funding goal, a second payout occurs at the end of the fundraiser.</p>
<p>If the funding goal is never met, payout occurs when the fundraiser ends.</p>

<b>All-or-Nothing</b>
<p>Pledges are paid out to a developer's Bountysource account as soon as the fundraiser breaches its funding goal. If the fundraiser raises more than its funding goal, a second payout occurs at the end of the fundraiser.</p>
