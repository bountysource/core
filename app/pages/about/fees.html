<h1>Fees & Payments</h1>

<h2>Fundraiser fees</h2>
<h3>Creating a Fundraiser</h3>
<p>We do not charge anything to create a Fundraiser. <a href="/fundraisers/new">Go create one now!</a></p>

<h3>Flexible Funding vs. All-or-nothing</h3>
<p>By default, all Fundraisers utilize a “Flexible Funding” model. This means that a developer will receive all money pledged to the Fundraiser even if the goal is not met.</p>
<p>However, developers can opt-in to an “All-or-nothing” campaign. In this model, a developer only receives the money pledged if the goal is met. Otherwise, all backers are refunded.</p>
<p>Read “When should I choose All-or-nothing?” in our FAQ for more information.</p>

<h3>Fundraiser payout</h3>
<p>A 10% fee is deducted from the amount raised. This fee includes the payment processing fees incurred for collecting pledges. There are no other fees or charges from Bountysource.</p>

<h3>Backing a Fundraiser</h3>
<p>You will be charged the exact amount you pledge the moment you make your pledge.</p>
<p>In the case of an “All-or-nothing” Fundraiser that fails to hit its goal, you will be refunded the pledged amount less a 10% fee.</p>

<br />
<h2>Bounty fees</h2>
<h3>Claiming a bounty</h3>
<p>We do not charge anything to claim a bounty. The amount displayed as the bounty total is the exact amount a developer will receive upon payout.</p>

<h3>Placing a bounty</h3>
<p>Bountysource charges a 10% non-refundable fee for placing bounties in addition to the specified bounty amount.</p>
<p>For example, to place a $1,000 bounty on an issue, you will be charged $1,100.</p>

<br />
<h2>Payments</h2>
<h3>“Payout” vs. “Cashout”</h3>
<p>A Payout is a transfer of money from Bountysource to a Bountysource account.</p>
<p>A Cashout is a withdrawal of your Bountysource balance. All cashouts are processed on a per-request basis. We can send you money via Paypal, Google Wallet, physical check or bank wire. Bountysource is not responsible for any fees incurred due to the chosen cashout method.</p>
<p>To request a cashout of your current Bountysource balance, please use contact us. Cashouts happen on the Friday following a request.</p>

<h3>Bounties</h3>
<p>Bounties are automatically paid out to a developer’s Bountysource account once their solution is accepted and merged.</p>
<p>You can request a cashout.</p>

<h3>Fundraisers</h3>
<h4>All-or-Nothing:</h4>
<p>Pledges are paid out to a developer’s Bountysource account as soon as the fundraiser breaches its funding goal. If the fundraiser raises more than its funding goal, a second payout occurs at the end of the fundraiser.</p>
