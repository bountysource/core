					<dt id="general-4"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#general-4">How does Bountysource work?</a></dt>
					<dd>There are two main functions: <a title="Click for perma-link" href="#fundraisers">Fundraisers</a> and <a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties">Bounties</a>.</dd>
					<dd><i>How <a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties">Bounties</a> work:</i></dd>
					<dd>
					  <ol>
						<li>Users fund bounties on open issues or feature requests they want to see addressed.</li>
						<li>These users spread the word about the bounty, enticing developers to create a solution.</li>
						<li>Developers create solutions and claim the bounty on Bountysource.</li>
						<li>Backers can accept or reject the claim</li>
						<li>If accepted, Bountysource pays the bounty to the developer.
						</li>
					  </ol>
					</dd>
					<dd><i>How <a title="Click for perma-link" href="#fundraisers">Fundraisers</a> work:</i></dd>
					<dd>
					  <ol>
						<li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and create a Fundraiser. Open-source fundraisers are typically used to
						  raise money for new projects, big updates to existing projects, or to raise money for bounties.
						</li>
						<li>The Fundraiser creator spreads the word about the Fundraiser to the appropriate communities.</li>
						<li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and make pledges to a Fundraiser, helping it reach its funding goal in
						  time.
						</li>
					  </ol>
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="general-5"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#general-5">Why should I use Bountysource?</a></dt>
					<dd>There are several benefits to using Bountysource:
					  <ul>
						<li><u>Increase development.</u> Encourage developers to submit quality pull requests more frequently by
						  creating bounties on existing issues.
						</li>
						<li><u>Close issues faster.</u> Incentivize unpopular but necessary issues by adding higher bounties on them.
						</li>
						<li><u>Earn money.</u> Create solutions to open issues and claim bounties within any project (including your
						  own).
						</li>
					  </ul>
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="general-6"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#general-6">I'm an admin / manager / committer on a project. What's my role in all of this?</a></dt>
					<dd>The more developers there are working on issues within your project, the more code/solutions you will receive.
					  You don't need to do anything out of the ordinary - just let your community know about the bounties, check for
					  and merge code as normal, and we take care of the rest.
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="general-7"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#general-7">I'm worried about introducing money into my community.</a></dt>
					<dd>This is a reasonable hesitation. However, money has already been a part of open-source for decades. Many open-source contributors are paid by their employers to work on open-source. Many projects already have donation buttons. Many open-source developers have consulting businesses around their projects.  Ultimately, the motivations behind open-source contributions already vary widely.  The easiest way to make sense of it all is to focus on the code itself.  At the end of the day, if high-quality code is being contributed to a project, the incentives behind the code should be irrelevant.

					<dt id="bounties-1"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-1">What is a bounty?</a></dt>
					<dd>A bounty is a cash reward put on a specific bug or feature request that encourages development.</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-2"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-2">Who can create a bounty?</a></dt>
					<dd>Anybody with a Google Wallet or PayPal account. We plan to support other payment methods (such as Bitcoins) in the future, if
					  there is a demand for it!
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-3"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-3">What can I put bounties on?</a></dt>
					<dd>You can create bounties on any open issue within any open-source project.</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-4"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-4">What does it cost to post a bounty?</a></dt>
					<dd>Bountysource charges a 10% non-refundable fee for placing bounties in addition to the specific bounty amount.
					  For example, to place a $50 bounty, you will be charged a total of $55.
					</dd>
					<dd>You will be required to pay the full amount of the bounty in order for the bounty to show up on
					  Bountysource.
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-5"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-5">Do I have to be affiliated with a project in order to put a bounty on an issue?</a></dt>
					<dd>No. Anybody can put a bounty on any issue, regardless of their relationship with the project.</dd>
					<hr>
					<!-- <dt>How do I add a/my project to Bountysource?</dt>
					<dd>Bountysource does not host projects. Instead, we read data from other issue trackers. You don't "add" a project to Bountysource, but you "tell" Bountysource about a project. You can tell Bountysource about a project via Search.</dd> -->
					<dt id="bounties-6"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-6">Does 100% of the bounty go to the developer?</a></dt>
					<dd>Yes. The developer who solves the issue will receive the full bounty displayed.</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-7"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-7">What does it cost to claim a bounty?</a></dt>
					<dd>Nothing. The amount displayed as the bounty total is the exact amount a developer will receive in their Bountysource account upon payout.
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-8"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-8">Can several people put bounties on the same issue?</a></dt>
					<dd>Yes! That is ideal. A $50 bounty from one person might not be appealing, but a $2,000 bounty from 25 people
					  would be!
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-9"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-9">What happens after I post a bounty?</a></dt>
					<dd>We monitor the issue until it's in a fixed/resolved state. After the issue is resolved, the developer who solved the issue can come to Bountysource to claim the bounty.
					If you're a Backer, we'll keep you informed (via email) of any Claim activity on the issue.
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-10"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-10">How are claims processed?</a></dt>
					<dd>
					When a bounty claim is submitted by a developer, the claim is put into a two week verification period.
					Backers are notified by email and can then accept or reject the claim.
					<ul>
					  <li>If all Backers vote to accept the claim, it is processed immediately and the developer is awarded the bounty.</li>
					  <li>If any Backer fails to accept the claim, it remains in the two week waiting period.</li>
					  <li>If any Backer has an issue with the claim, they can reject it. Claims cannot be paid out until the dispute is resolved and the rejected status is lifted.</li>
					</ul>
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-11"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-11">What if I'm unsatisfied with the solution to an issue I've backed?</a></dt>
					<dd>After a claim is submitted, you will have two weeks to open any disputes you may have.</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-12"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-12">How can I keep track of all the bounties I've posted?</a></dt>
					<dd>You can view all of the issues you've backed via your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bountysource.com/activity/bounties">Activity
					  page</a>.
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-13"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-13">An issue I've backed has been closed. When will the solution be made available to the public?</a></dt>
					<dd>We have no control over when a project makes a new release. We award a bounty once code has been merged into
					  the project. The rest is up to project owners and committers.
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-14"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-14">What happens if an issue I've backed is closed without resolution?</a></dt>
					<dd>If the issue was closed because it was a duplicate of another issue, we will transfer the bounty to the appropriate issue.</dd>
					<dd>If the issue was closed as a "won't fix", or is deemed not in line with the project's goals, the bounty amount is refunded.</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-15"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-15">How do you know a project committer will accept any pull requests at all?</a></dt>
					<dd>We don't guarantee this, but one of the main points of open-source software and making code public is to
					  foster improvement. Committers are always monitoring pull requests, and they likely will accept any and all code
					  they feel is of quality.
					</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-16"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-16">How do I receive payment?</a></dt>
					<dd>Once your claim has been accepted the money is automatically placed into your Bountysource account. To request a cashout of your current Bountysource balance, please <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bountysource.com/activity/transactions">click here</a>.</dd>
					<hr>
					<dt id="bounties-17"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#bounties-17">Do I have to pay taxes on bounties I collect?</a></dt>
					<dd>If you are in the United States and payments made to you are more than $600 for the year, we are required to
					  issue you a Form 1099 to report the payments, which will require you to complete a Form W-9. You should consult
					  your tax advisor as to the taxability of the payments.

					</dd>
					<dd>As a default, Bountysource fundraisers employ the "flexible funding" model. This means that a fundraiser creator receives all money pledged, regardless of whether or not the funding goal is met.
					</dd>
					<dd>Fundraiser creators can opt-in to a "all-or-nothing" model, where they only receive money if the funding goal is met. To opt-in, <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">contact support</a>.</dd>

					<hr>
					<dt id="fundraisers-5"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#fundraisers-5">What fees are there?</a></dt>
					<dd>A 10% fee is deducted from each pledge. This fee includes the payment processing fees incurred for collecting pledges. There are no other fees or charges from Bountysource. For more information, please see our <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/fees">Pricing page</a>.

					<dt id="fundraisers-1"><a title="Click for perma-link" href="#fundraisers-1">When do I get paid?</a></dt>

						<ul>
							<li>We help legitimize open-source projects by connecting them with top tech companies like Adobe, Walmart Labs and Mozilla. We have an entire team dedicated to connecting developers with potential sponsors.
