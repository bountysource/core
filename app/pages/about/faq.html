      <dl>
        <dt><h4 id="what-is-bountysource">What is Bountysource?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Bountysource is the funding platform for open-source software. Users can improve the open-source projects they love by creating/collecting bounties and pledging to fundraisers.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="what-types-of-projects-are-allowed-on-bountysource">What types of projects are allowed on Bountysource?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Any type of Open-Source or Free Software (as in speech) projects are allowed. Generally speaking, any software licenses approved by either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation are acceptable.</p>
          <p>See a full list of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">GNU</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">OSI-approved</a> licenses.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Free Software and Open-Source software are, generally speaking, two sides of the same coin. Both can be considered separate movements within the same community, but with varying goals. We suggest you read up on both sides yourself to better understand them.</p>

        <dt><h4 id="how-does-bountysource-work">How does Bountysource work?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>There are two main functions: Fundraisers and Bounties.</p>
          <p><i>How Bounties work:</i></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Users fund bounties on open issues or feature requests they want to see addressed.</li>
            <li>These users spread the word about the bounty, enticing developers to create a solution.</li>
            <li>Developers create solutions and claim the bounty on Bountysource.</li>
            <li>Backers can accept or reject the claim</li>
            <li>If accepted, Bountysource pays the bounty to the developer.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><i>How Fundraisers work:</i></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and create a Fundraiser. Open-source fundraisers are typically used to raise money for new projects, big updates to existing projects, or to raise money for bounties.</li>
            <li>The Fundraiser creator spreads the word about the Fundraiser to the appropriate communities.</li>
            <li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and make pledges to a Fundraiser, helping it reach its funding goal in time.</li>
          </ol>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="why-should-i-use-bountysource">Why should I use Bountysource?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>There are several benefits to using Bountysource:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Increase development.</u> Encourage developers to submit quality pull requests more frequently by creating bounties on existing issues.</li>
            <li><u>Close issues faster.</u> Incentivize unpopular but necessary issues by adding higher bounties on them.</li>
            <li><u>Earn money.</u> Create solutions to open issues and claim bounties within any project (including your own).</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="i-m-an-admin-manager-committer-on-a-project-what-s-my-role-in-all-of-this">I'm an admin/manager/committer on a project. What's my role in all of this?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The more developers there are working on issues within your project, the more code/solutions you will receive. You don't need to do anything out of the ordinary - just let your community know about the bounties, check for and merge code as normal, and we take care of the rest.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="i-m-worried-about-introducing-money-into-my-community">I'm worried about introducing money into my community.</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This is a reasonable hesitation. However, money has already been a part of open-source for decades. Many open-source contributors are paid by their employers to work on open-source. Many projects already have donation buttons. Many open-source developers have consulting businesses around their projects.  Ultimately, the motivations behind open-source contributions already vary widely.  The easiest way to make sense of it all is to focus on the code itself.  At the end of the day, if high-quality code is being contributed to a project, the incentives behind the code should be irrelevant.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><h4 id="what-is-a-bounty">What is a bounty?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A bounty is a cash reward put on a specific bug or feature request that encourages development.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="who-can-create-a-bounty">Who can create a bounty?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Anybody with a Google Wallet or PayPal account. We plan to support other payment methods (such as Bitcoins) in the future, if there is a demand for it!</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="what-can-i-put-bounties-on">What can I put bounties on?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>You can create bounties on any open issue within any open-source project.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="what-does-it-cost-to-post-a-bounty">What does it cost to post a bounty?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Bountysource charges a 10% non-refundable fee for placing bounties in addition to the specific bounty amount. For example, to place a $50 bounty, you will be charged a total of $55.</p>
          <p>You will be required to pay the full amount of the bounty in order for the bounty to show up on Bountysource.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="do-i-have-to-be-affiliated-with-a-project-in-order-to-put-a-bounty-on-an-issue">Do I have to be affiliated with a project in order to put a bounty on an issue?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>No. Anybody can put a bounty on any issue, regardless of their relationship with the project.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Bountysource does not host projects. Instead, we read data from other issue trackers. You don't "add" a project to Bountysource, but you "tell" Bountysource about a project. You can tell Bountysource about a project via Search.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="does-100-of-the-bounty-go-to-the-developer">Does 100% of the bounty go to the developer?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Yes. The developer who solves the issue will receive the full bounty displayed.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="what-does-it-cost-to-claim-a-bounty">What does it cost to claim a bounty?</h4></dt>

        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="can-several-people-put-bounties-on-the-same-issue">Can several people put bounties on the same issue?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Yes! That is ideal. A $50 bounty from one person might not be appealing, but a $2,000 bounty from 25 people would be!</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="what-happens-after-i-post-a-bounty">What happens after I post a bounty?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>We monitor the issue until it's in a fixed/resolved state. After the issue is resolved, the developer who solved the issue can come to Bountysource to claim the bounty. If you're a Backer, we'll keep you informed (via email) of any Claim activity on the issue.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="how-are-claims-processed">How are claims processed?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>When a bounty claim is submitted by a developer, the claim is put into a two week verification period. Backers are notified by email and can then accept or reject the claim.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If all Backers vote to accept the claim, it is processed immediately and the developer is awarded the bounty.</li>
            <li>If any Backer fails to accept the claim, it remains in the two week waiting period.</li>
            <li>If any Backer has an issue with the claim, they can reject it. Claims cannot be paid out until the dispute is resolved and the rejected status is lifted.</li>
          </ul>

        <dd>
          <p>After a claim is submitted, you will have two weeks to open any disputes you may have.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>You can view all of the issues you've backed via your <a target="_blank" href="/activity/bounties">Activity page</a>.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>We have no control over when a project makes a new release. We award a bounty once code has been merged into the project. The rest is up to project owners and committers.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="what-happens-if-an-issue-i-ve-backed-is-closed-without-resolution">What happens if an issue I've backed is closed without resolution?</h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>If the issue was closed because it was a duplicate of another issue, we will transfer the bounty to the appropriate issue.</p>
          <p>If the issue was closed as a "won't fix", or is deemed not in line with the project's goals, the bounty amount is refunded.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>We don't guarantee this, but one of the main points of open-source software and making code public is to foster improvement. Committers are always monitoring pull requests, and they likely will accept any and all code they feel is of quality.</p>

        <dt><h4 id="how-do-i-receive-payment">How do I receive payment?</h4></dt>
        <dd>

        <dd>
          <p>If you are in the United States and payments made to you are more than $600 for the year, we are required to issue you a Form 1099 to report the payments, which will require you to complete a Form W-9. You should consult your tax advisor as to the taxability of the payments.</p>

          <p>A Fundraiser is a time-limited campaign that allows open-source developers to raise money from their community.</p>
          <p>As a default, Bountysource fundraisers employ the "flexible funding" model. This means that a fundraiser creator receives all money pledged, regardless of whether or not the funding goal is met.</p>
          <p>Fundraiser creators can opt-in to a "all-or-nothing" model, where they only receive money if the funding goal is met. To opt-in, <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">contact support</a>.</p>

          <p>All-or-nothing: Backers are refunded their pledge amount less the Bountysource fee.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="what-fees-are-there">What fees are there?</h4></dt>
        <dd>A 10% fee is deducted from each pledge. This fee includes the payment processing fees incurred for collecting pledges. There are no other fees or charges from Bountysource. For more information, please see our <a href="/fees">Pricing page</a>.

          <ul>
            <li>We help legitimize open-source projects by connecting them with top tech companies like Adobe, Walmart Labs and Mozilla. We have an entire team dedicated to connecting developers with potential sponsors.</li>
            <li>Our platform is tailor-made for developers, and is designed to minimize overhead administration in order to allow the developer to focus entirely fulfilling milestones promised in their fundraiser. With that in mind, we offer full-service merchandise fulfillment for standard fundraising perks such as T-shirts and stickers. Please <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">contact us</a> for more details.</li>
            <li>We're not just an arbiter of funds. Our team works side-by-side with developers to support their projects that are using the system. Users have a direct line of communication with us via <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/bountysource">IRC (#bountysource on Freenode)</a>.</li>
