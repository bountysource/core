    <h2>General</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>What types of projects are allowed on Bountysource?</dt>
      <dd>Any type of Open-Source or Free Software (as in speech) projects are allowed. Generally speaking, any software
        licenses approved by either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation are acceptable. For a
        full list of OSI-approved licenses, please see <a target="_blank"

      </dd>
      <dt>You mentioned Free Software. How is that different from Open-Source?</dt>
      <dd>Free Software and Open-Source software are, generally speaking, two sides of the same coin. Both can be
        considered separate movements within the same community, but with varying goals. We suggest you read up on both
        sides yourself to better understand them.

      <dt>How does Bountysource work?</dt>
      <dd>There are two main functions: Fundraisers and Bounties.</dd>
      <dd><i>How Bounties work:</i></dd>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>Users fund bounties on open issues or feature requests they want to see addressed.</li>
          <li>These users spread the word about the bounty, enticing developers to create a solution.</li>
          <li>Developers create solutions and submit them on Bountysource.</li>
          <li>Bountysource tracks these solutions, sees which one gets accepted by the open-source project, and then
            pays the bounty to the developer.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
      <dd><i>How Fundraisers work:</i></dd>
      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and create a Fundraiser. Open-source fundraisers are typically used to
            raise money for new projects, big updates to existing projects, or to raise money for bounties.
          </li>
          <li>The Fundraiser creator spreads the word about the Fundraiser to their communities.</li>
          <li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and make pledges to a Fundraiser, helping it reach its funding goal in
            time.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </dd>

      <dt>What makes Fundraisers different from Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc?</dt>
      <dd>Several things:</dd>
      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>We're focused entirely on open-source software, so our user base is more valuable in that sense.
            Bountysource users are familiar with the open-source community and projects; there's a higher chance of
            gaining contributions upon discovery as opposed to crowdfunding sites that cater to all types of projects.
          </li>
          <li>We offer reward fulfillment for physical goods - from creation to delivery. If you're interested in
            starting a Fundraiser and want shirts, stickers, thumbdrives, or more please <a
              href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">contact us</a> for more details!
          </li>
          <li>Users have a direct line of communication with the team - no hoops to jump through, you can find the
            entire team on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/bountysource">IRC (#bountysource on Freenode)</a>.
          </li>
          <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bountysource/frontend">Our front-end is open-source</a>! See
            things you don't like? Feel free to make changes and submit the code to us for review.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Why should I use Bountysource?</dt>
      <dd>There are several benefits to using Bountysource:
        <ul>
          <li><u>Increase development.</u> Encourage developers to submit quality pull requests more frequently by
            creating bounties on existing issues.
          </li>
          <li><u>Close issues faster.</u> Incentivize unpopular but necessary issues by adding higher bounties on them.
          </li>
          <li><u>Earn money.</u> Create solutions to open issues and collect bounties within any project (including your
            own).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>I'm an admin/manager/committer on a project. What's my role in all of this?</dt>
      <dd>The more developers there are working on issues within your project, the more code/solutions you will receive.
        You don't need to do anything out of the ordinary - just let your community know about the bounties, check for
        and merge code as normal, and we take care of the rest.
      </dd>
      <dt>I'm worried about introducing money into my community.</dt>
      <dd>This is a valid and common hesitation. However, one of the main points of open-source software and making code
        public is to foster improvement. Regardless of someone's motivations, if quality code is being contributed to a
        project - due to a bounty or otherwise - there shouldn't be any issues.

    <span id="bounties"></span>

    <h2>Bounties</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>What is a bounty?</dt>
      <dd>A bounty is money offered as a reward for successfully resolving an issue within an open-source project.</dd>
      <dt>Who can create a bounty?</dt>
      <dd>Anybody with a Google Wallet or PayPal account. We plan to support other payment methods (such as Bitcoins) if
        there's demand for it!
      </dd>
      <dt>What can I put bounties on?</dt>
      <dd>You can create bounties on any open issue within any open-source project.</dd>
      <dt>What does it cost to post a bounty?</dt>
      <dd>Bountysource charges a 10% non-refundable fee for placing bounties in addition to the specific bounty amount.
        For example, to place a $50 bounty, you will be charged a total of $55.
      </dd>
      <dd>You will be required to pay the full amount of the bounty in order for the bounty to show up on
        Bountysource.
      </dd>
      <dt>Does 100% of the bounty go to the developer?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. The developer who solves the issue will receive the full bounty displayed.</dd>
      <dt>Who can claim a bounty?</dt>
      <dd>Anybody who submits an accepted solution to us.</dd>
      <dt>When is a solution considered accepted?</dt>
      <dd>When project committers/maintainers merge the solution into the project and close out the underlying issue.
      </dd>
      <dt>What does it cost to claim a bounty?</dt>
      <dd>Nothing. The amount displayed as the bounty total is the exact amount a developer will receive upon payout.
      </dd>
      <dt>Can several people put bounties on the same issue?</dt>
      <dd>Yes! That is ideal. A $50 bounty from 1 person might not be appealing, but a $2,000 bounty from 25 people
        might be.
      </dd>
      <dt>What happens after I post a bounty?</dt>
      <dd>We'll let you know when a solution is accepted for an issue you've backed. At that point, you will have two
        weeks to verify that it does what you want it to before we pay the developer.
      </dd>
      <dt>How can I keep track of all the bounties I've posted?</dt>
      <dd>You can view all of the issues you've backed via your <a target="_blank"
                                                                   href="https://www.bountysource.com/#contributions">Contributions
        page</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>What if I'm unsatisfied with the solution to an issue I've backed?</dt>
      <dd>After a solution is accepted, you will have two weeks to open any disputes you may have.</dd>
      <dd>If you feel that an accepted solution does not meet the criteria of the issue, please email us at <a
        href="mailto:support@bountysource.com?subject=Dispute">support@bountysource.com</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>An issue I've backed has been closed. When will the solution be made available to the public?</dt>
      <dd>We have no control over when a project makes a new release. We award a bounty once code has been merged into
        the project. The rest is up to project owners and committers.
      </dd>
      <dt>What happens if an issue I've backed is closed without a solution?</dt>
      <dd>If an issue with bounties is closed without a solution, all backers are refunded.</dd>
      <dt>How do you know a project committer will accept any pull requests at all?</dt>
      <dd>We don't guarantee this, but one of the main points of open-source software and making code public is to
        foster improvement. Committers are always monitoring pull requests, and they likely will accept any and all code
        they feel is of quality.
      </dd>
      <dt>How do I know if my solution has been accepted or rejected?</dt>
      <dd>You can check on the status of your solutions via your <a target="_blank"
                                                                    href="https://www.bountysource.com/#solutions">Solutions
        page</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>My solution was accepted. When do I get paid?</dt>
      <dd>Once a solution is accepted, it enters a two-week dispute period. If there are no outstanding disputes, you
        get paid after this period.
      </dd>
      <dt>How do I receive payment?</dt>
      <dd>You can receive payment via Google Wallet, Paypal, or a physical check.</dd>
      <dt>Do I have to pay taxes on bounties I collect?</dt>
      <dd>If you are in the United States and payments made to you are more than $600 for the year, we are required to
        issue you a Form 1099 to report the payments, which will require you to complete a Form W-9. You should consult
        your tax advisor as to the taxability of the payments.

    <h2>Fundraisers</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>What is a Fundraiser?</dt>
      <dd>A means of collecting monetary contributions for a specific goal. In particular, Bountysource Fundraisers are
        primarily used to raise money for new projects, new versions of existing projects, or for bounties.
      </dd>
      <dt>Who can create a fundraiser?</dt>
      <dd>Anybody!</dd>
      <dt>What does it cost to start a fundraiser?</dt>
      <dd>Nothing! Go <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bountysource.com/#account/create_fundraiser">start one</a>
        today.
      </dd>
      <dt>Are there fees charged at the end of a fundraiser?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. There is a 10% fee on all pledges. If a fundraiser meets its goal, the fee is deducted from the amount
        raised. If unsuccessful, the fee is deducted from each backer's refund.
      </dd>
      <dt>When do I get paid?</dt>
      <dd>We usually make two payouts - the first payout happens when the fundraiser meets its goal and the second
        payout happens when the fundraiser expires (for all additional pledges made).
      </dd>
