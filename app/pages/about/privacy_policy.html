<p>We may collect information about you in any one or more of the following ways:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>3.1 Information about Your Activity on our Websites and Services</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">When you use our Services or Websites, we collect and store certain information that
  you provide directly or through a third party website that is offering our Services. To provide a better user
  experience, we also collect information about your interaction with other users and the Service. The bulk of this
  information is collected and stored through the use of Log Files, which are files on our web servers that record
  actions taken on our Website and Services.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>3.2 Communications Features</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">You may be able to take part in certain activities on our Websites or Services that
  give you the opportunity to communicate or share information not just with Bountysource, but also with other users
  of our Services. These include:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">
<ul>
  <li>posting information about a particular Issue or Solution</li>
  <li>participating in forums and message boards</li>
  <li>posting public comments to other users' profiles</li>

    accounts

consent to the recording and storage of such communications for these purposes.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>3.3 Cookies and Automated Information Collection</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">When you access our Websites and Services, we collect certain technical information in
  order to (i) analyze the usage of our Websites and Services; (ii) provide a more personalized experience; and (iii)
  manage advertising. We and service providers acting on our behalf, such as Google Analytics, use Log Files and
  tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, including cookies, IP
  addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser language, referring and exit pages, and URLs,
  platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the
  amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of activity on our Websites or Services, and other
  similar information.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">We may also employ other technologies including (i) web beacons, which allow us to know
  if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise
  more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying the source of a new
  installation or delivering ads to you on other websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies,
  which help us to prevent fraud, remember your site preferences and speed up load times.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on your
  computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies and cookie
  management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage flash
  cookies you can visit <a target="_blank"
                           href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>.
  If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of our Services, as Bountysource cookies
  are necessary to track and enhance your activities. Please note that companies delivering advertisements on our
  Websites may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices are subject to their own policies.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>3.4 Other Sources</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">We may collect or receive information about you from other sources including (i) other
  Bountysource users who choose to upload their email contacts; (ii) social networks (if you use these features of our
  Service); (iii) repositories such as GitHub; and (iv) third party information providers. This information will be
  used to supplement your profile, to help you and your contacts connect, to help manage and offer Service you
  request, and to offer you Services in which you may be interested. It may be combined with other information we
  collect.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>3.5 Repositories</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">We may also collect or receive data and information about you from repositories (e.g.,
  GitHub). This information might include the date and time when you submitted a proposed Solution to a particular
  Issue. We collect this information to enable us to efficiently administer our Services.</p>

<h2>4. How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>

<p>In general, we collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and
  customized experience. For example, we may use information collected from you in any one or more of the following
  ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to create your accounts and allow use of our Services</li>
  <li>to provide technical support and respond to user inquiries</li>
  <li>to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities</li>
  <li>to enforce our Terms of Service</li>
  <li>to notify users of updates to our Services, Terms of Service, or other rules and policies</li>
  <li>to solicit input and feedback to improve our Services and customize your user experience</li>
  <li>to inform users about new Services or promotional offers</li>
  <li>to assist in resolving disputes and administering the use of our Services</li>
  <li>to engage in commonly accepted practices, such as contacting you at the email address we have on file if you are
    a potential winner in a contest or sweepstakes
  </li>
  <li>to identify and suggest connections with other Bountysource users</li>
  <li>to enable user-to-user communications</li>
  <li>to deliver and target advertising</li>
</ul>
<p>One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to Bountysource,
  we'll use it to respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you informed of your account activity. Some
  messages, such as invites for friends to join Bountysource, may include your name and profile photo. We may also
  send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages ("<b>Promotional Communications</b>") directly or in
  partnership with parties other than Bountysource. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer recipients
  choices about receiving additional messages.</p>

<h2>5. Sharing of Your Information</h2>

<p>We will share your information (in some cases personal information) with third parties, that is parties other than
  Bountysource, in the following circumstances:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>5.1 Third Party Service Providers</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">We will provide your information to third party companies to perform services on our
  behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service and to
  assist us in our marketing efforts. We direct all such third party service providers to maintain the confidentiality
  of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services
  on Bountysource's behalf.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>5.2 Friends and Other Bountysource Users</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">The Service supports and may encourage interaction among users. In most Bountysource
  Services your social networks friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions of your activity. In many
  Bountysource Services friends and other users will be able to see your profile, which may include your name and your
  profile photo. Other users may also be able to send you communications through our or the related social networks’
  communication channels.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>5.3 Advertising of Third Party Products and Services</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">We do not actively share personal information with third party advertisers for their
  direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent. We may share (i) aggregated information (information
  about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you); (ii) anonymous information; and
  (iii) certain technical information (including IP Addresses and mobile device IDs) to develop and deliver targeted
  advertising in the Service and on the websites of third parties. We may also allow advertisers to collect these
  types of information within the Service and they may share it with us. Advertisers may collect this information
  through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used
  to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your user experience by ensuring that
  advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and
  to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience). To
  learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, you
  can visit the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising
    Initiative</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a>.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;"><b>5.4 Safety, Security and Compliance with Law</b></p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications (including
  without limitation IP addresses and your personal information) may be accessed and monitored as necessary to provide
  the Service and may be disclosed: (i) when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the
  information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy
  any applicable laws or regulations (iii) where we believe that the Service is being used in the commission of a
  crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations
  for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when we have a good faith belief that there is
  an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and (v)
  in order to protect our rights or property, including to enforce our <a target="_blank" href="#termsofservice">Terms
    of Service</a> or other agreements between you and us.</p>

  other legitimate non-marketing reasons.</p>

<h2>9. International Transfers</h2>

<p>If you are visiting this website from a country other than the country in which our servers are located (the United
  States), your communications with us may result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By
  visiting this website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to such transfers.</p>

<h2>10. Privacy Policies of Linked Sites and Advertisers</h2>

<p>Our Website and Services may contain site links or advertisements from companies other than Bountysource that may
  link to their own websites. For example, our Service works in conjunction with Repositories such as GitHub, but we
  are not affiliated with these Repositories in any legal or corporate sense. We are not responsible for the privacy
  practices or the content of such websites. If you have any questions about how these other websites use your
  information, you should review their policies and contact them directly.</p>

<h2>11. Security of Your Information</h2>

<p>Bountysource implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and
  offline, and we are committed to the protection of customer information.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">11.1 User account information is protected by the password each member uses to access
  their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you
  immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Bountysource
  account, the Website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password.
  When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual
  currency), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">11.2 While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our
  Websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we
  cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to
  take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account
  after use. If your social networks account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized use of your Bountysource
  account, so be careful to keep your account information secure. If you have questions about the security of our
  Websites, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@bountysource.com</a>.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 15px;">11.3 Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely
  secure. Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is
  being transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we
  have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you and other users by placing a notice
  on Bountysource.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address we have on file for you. We may supplement this
  process by placing notices in our Services and on other Bountysource Websites. You should periodically check <a
    target="_blank" href="https://www.bountysource.com">www.bountysource.com</a> and this privacy page for updates.
</p>

<h2>13. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you
  affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is
  participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on our Website. If you do ask us to share your personal
  information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that
  specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party (other than our service providers) on a
  continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do
  not opt in to such use when you provide personal information on one of our Websites.</p>

<p>Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to access personal information held about themselves. Your right of
  access can be exercised in accordance with applicable law. Please submit any requests for access to your personal
  data in writing to <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@bountysource.com</a>.</p>
