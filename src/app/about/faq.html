        <dd>
          <p>Bountysource is the funding platform for open-source software. Users can improve the open-source projects they love by creating/collecting bounties and pledging to fundraisers.</p>
        </dd>

          <p>Any type of Open-Source or Free Software (as in speech) projects are allowed. Generally speaking, any software licenses approved by either the Open Source Initiative or the Free Software Foundation are acceptable.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Free Software and Open-Source software are, generally speaking, two sides of the same coin. Both can be considered separate movements within the same community, but with varying goals. We suggest you read up on both sides yourself to better understand them.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>There are two main functions: Fundraisers and Bounties.</p>
          <p><i>How Bounties work:</i></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Users fund bounties on open issues or feature requests they want to see addressed.</li>
            <li>These users spread the word about the bounty, enticing developers to create a solution.</li>
            <li>Developers create solutions and claim the bounty on Bountysource.</li>
            <li>Backers can accept or reject the claim</li>
            <li>If accepted, Bountysource pays the bounty to the developer.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><i>How Fundraisers work:</i></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and create a Fundraiser. Open-source fundraisers are typically used to raise money for new projects, big updates to existing projects, or to raise money for bounties.</li>
            <li>The Fundraiser creator spreads the word about the Fundraiser to the appropriate communities.</li>
            <li>Anyone can come to Bountysource and make pledges to a Fundraiser, helping it reach its funding goal in time.</li>
          </ol>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="why-should-i-use-bountysource"><a href="/faq#why-should-i-use-bountysource">Why should I use Bountysource?</a></h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>There are several benefits to using Bountysource:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Increase development.</u> Encourage developers to submit quality pull requests more frequently by creating bounties on existing issues.</li>
            <li><u>Close issues faster.</u> Incentivize unpopular but necessary issues by adding higher bounties on them.</li>
            <li><u>Earn money.</u> Create solutions to open issues and claim bounties within any project (including your own).</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="i-m-an-admin-manager-committer-on-a-project-what-s-my-role-in-all-of-this"><a href="/faq#i-m-an-admin-manager-committer-on-a-project-what-s-my-role-in-all-of-this">I'm an admin/manager/committer on a project. What's my role in all of this?</a></h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The more developers there are working on issues within your project, the more code/solutions you will receive. You don't need to do anything out of the ordinary - just let your community know about the bounties, check for and merge code as normal, and we take care of the rest.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><h4 id="i-m-worried-about-introducing-money-into-my-community"><a href="/faq#i-m-worried-about-introducing-money-into-my-community">I'm worried about introducing money into my community.</a></h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This is a reasonable hesitation. However, money has already been a part of open-source for decades. Many open-source contributors are paid by their employers to work on open-source. Many projects already have donation buttons. Many open-source developers have consulting businesses around their projects.  Ultimately, the motivations behind open-source contributions already vary widely.  The easiest way to make sense of it all is to focus on the code itself.  At the end of the day, if high-quality code is being contributed to a project, the incentives behind the code should be irrelevant.</p>

          <p>A bounty is a cash reward put on a specific bug or feature request that encourages development.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Anybody with a Google Wallet or PayPal account. We plan to support other payment methods (such as Bitcoins) in the future, if there is a demand for it!</p>

          <p>There are no fees associated with posting a bounty. For example, to post a $500 bounty, you will be charged $500. For more information on our fee structure, see our <a href="/fees">Pricing page</a>.</p>

          <p>No. Anybody can put a bounty on any issue, regardless of their relationship with the project.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Bountysource does not host projects. Instead, we read data from other issue trackers. You don't "add" a project to Bountysource, but you "tell" Bountysource about a project. You can tell Bountysource about a project via Search.</p>

          <p>Nothing. The amount displayed as the bounty total is the exact amount a developer will receive in their Bountysource account upon payout.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Yes! That is ideal. A $50 bounty from one person might not be appealing, but a $2,000 bounty from 25 people would be!</p>

          <p>We monitor the issue until it's in a fixed/resolved state. After the issue is resolved, the developer who solved the issue can come to Bountysource to claim the bounty. If you're a Backer, we'll keep you informed (via email) of any Claim activity on the issue.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If all Backers vote to accept the claim, it is processed immediately and the developer is awarded the bounty.</li>
            <li>If any Backer fails to accept the claim, it remains in the two week waiting period.</li>
            <li>If any Backer has an issue with the claim, they can reject it. Claims cannot be paid out until the dispute is resolved and the rejected status is lifted.</li>

When will the solution be made available to the public?</a></h4></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>We have no control over when a project makes a new release. We award a bounty once code has been merged into the project. The rest is up to project owners and committers.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>We don't guarantee this, but one of the main points of open-source software and making code public is to foster improvement. Committers are always monitoring pull requests, and they likely will accept any and all code they feel is of quality.</p>

            <li>Our platform is tailor-made for developers, and is designed to minimize overhead administration in order to allow the developer to focus entirely fulfilling milestones promised in their fundraiser.

            <li>We're not just an arbiter of funds. Our team works side-by-side with developers to support their projects that are using the system. Users have a direct line of communication with us via <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/bountysource">IRC (#bountysource on Freenode)</a>.</li>
