    <h1>Fees & Payments</h1>
    <h2>TL;DR No fees on spending or earning. 10% fee to withdraw.</h2>
  </div>



  <h3>Spending Money</h3>
  <p>There are no fees associated with posting a bounty, pledging a fundraiser, or gifting to a team. All payment processing fees are covered by Bountysource.</p>
  <p>For example, posting a $1,000 bounty from Paypal costs you exactly $1,000.</p>

  <h3>Earning Money</h3>
  <h4 class="text-muted">Claiming a Bounty</h4>
  <p>We do not charge any fees to claim a bounty. The amount displayed as the bounty total is the amount that will be transferred to your Bountysource account.</p>

  <h4 class="text-muted">Fundraisers & Team Contributions</h4>
  <p>We do not charge any fees on contributions to a team or a fundraiser. For example, 100% of a $1,000 pledge will go into the team account.</p>
  <p>All pledges and team contributions will be available to the team as soon as the payment clears.</p>

  <h3>Withdrawals</h3>
  <p>Bountysource charges a 10% fee on all withdrawals from your Bountysource account. This includes any money earned from Bounties, Fundraisers, or Donations.</p>
  <p>To request a cash out, please use the <a href="/activity/cash_outs/new">cash out form</a>. We can send you money via Paypal, Bitcoin, or physical check. Bountysource is not responsible for any fees that may be incurred due to the chosen payment method.</p>
