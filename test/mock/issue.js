This is where we're enlisting your help!</p>\n\n<p>We're happy with the content on all pages. Feel free to modify the layout as you see fit to meet your own design/ux objectives. The design must have a predominantly white background, with a flat and simplistic design. The design should be free of noise -- \"crisp\", \"bright\", and \"colorful\" are all adjectives we'd like to use to describe our new design.</p>\n\n<h4>Sites we like:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://shift.com/\">https://shift.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ooomf.com/\">https://ooomf.com/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://newrelic.com/\">https://newrelic.com/</a></li>\n<li>FlatUI - <a href=\"http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/\">http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to submit a design</h2>\n\n<p>Submit a pull request with CSS/JavaScript changes. If you want to start with a mockup, you can submit a PR with just an image. We will provide feedback directly in the Pull Request thread.</p>\n\n<p>This contest will run and be considered complete only when we have our winning design <em>implemented in the frontend</em>. This means 100% application of the design to all of our frontend's pages. The bounty will be paid out if a PR is accepted.</p>\n\n<p>We reserve the right to merge multiple pull requests and split the bounty among multiple developers, if needed.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is a <strong><a href=\"https://www.bountysource.com/issues/651929-design-contest-improve-bountysource-s-bootstrap-angular-website-2-020?utm_campaign=plugin&amp;utm_content=tracker%2F47&amp;utm_medium=issues&amp;utm_source=github\">$2,020 open bounty</a></strong> on this issue.

      "body_html": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/eric-brechemier\" class=\"user-mention\">@eric-brechemier</a> thank you for putting those notes together, nice work!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/alixaxel\" class=\"user-mention\">@alixaxel</a> good work on the initial front page mock, here's some feedback that should help push it forward:</p>\n\n<h4>Header</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>looks good! Where'd the search bar go? It should be accessible on all pages at all times.</li>\n</ul><h4>\"Pushing Open-source\" section</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I'd like to see this section be shorter... probably about 2/3rd the current height</li>\n<li>Remove the \"Pushing open-source...\" and replace it with \"Bountysource is the funding platform...\" text</li>\n</ul><p>I want to add \"Social proof\" to either the top-most section or as a new section below it, based on whatever looks best. I think this could exist next to the Learn More / Sign In box you have now. This section should be a scrolling list of quotes/tweets from our users (\"'Bountysource is the best thing ever' - John Doe\", \"Using Bountysource has allowed us to bla bla bla\" - Acme Company, etc). There are tons of examples here: <a href=\"http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/stylish-blockquotes-pullquotes/\">http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/stylish-blockquotes-pullquotes/</a></p>\n\n<h4>The three cards</h4>\n\n<p>I like the idea and I think the cards should be, in order:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Get your problem solved\" - Create a bounty - This card should have a search box in it and very clearly state that you can create a bounty by pasting the URL of the issue directly from any external issue tracker (Github, Jira, Google Code, etc) or you can enter search terms</li>\n<li>\"Earn Money\" - Find a bounty and earn money - this will go to a TBD bounty search. For now it could be our regular search page.</li>\n<li>\"Empower your engineering team\" - promote our teams / enterprise support. This should sell the fact that you can sign up your team, set a budget, and let your engineers post bounties on behalf of the team as needed (<a href=\"https://www.bountysource.com/enterprise\">https://www.bountysource.com/enterprise</a>).</li>\n</ul><p>The quotes are not the exact headline I want, but the general theme the section should evoke. We can iterate on wording whenever it makes sense.</p>\n\n<h4>Members / Leaderboard section</h4>\n\n<p>I'd like to rethink this section entirely and make it feel more like a leaderboard. Stylistically, I don't like the circular portraits and we should stick to squares.</p>\n\n<p>We have two types of data, \"newest\" and \"top/competitive\".</p>\n\n<p>The \"Newest\" should be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Users</li>\n<li>Most Recent Bounties</li>\n</ul><p>The top / competitive data should be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Top Backers</li>\n<li>Top Earners</li>\n<li>Top Bounties\n...each of these should have a time selector of \"Recent\" or \"All-time\"</li>\n</ul><p>The newest data should be thought of as a timeline and can be listed horizontally, if that's the most aesthetically pleasing. The \"top\" data should be in a list view (along with user portrait) </p>\n\n<p>A simple text-only leaderboard from Humblebundle.com as an example:<br><a href=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2245234/1196434/cf2e5e00-24ae-11e3-975c-9731b7b33ec8.png\"><img src=\"https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2245234/1196434/cf2e5e00-24ae-11e3-975c-9731b7b33ec8.png\" alt=\"image\"></a></p>\n\n<h4>Projects / Fundraisers</h4>\n\n<p>I really like the side-by-side presentation of projects/fundraisers. Let's make the logos larger and have all text and the progress bar fit to the right of the logos.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting idea to put progress bars on the Projects for symmetry, but I don't think it makes sense to measure bounties in that way. It might work if you replace the % text with the actual text you have to the right of the progress (e.g. instead of 9% for Bountysource Frontend it says \"$485 claimed\" and \"$5020 unclaimed\" instead of 91%, but even then I don't feel like the progress bar is the best visualization, as bounties shouldn't have an end.</p>\n\n<p>I like the second progress marker for overfunded, but I'm not so sure that's immediately obvious. It may be better to have 100% be a set length, with any \"overfunding\" being added on to that.</p>\n\n<h4>Footer</h4>\n\n<p>Looks good! For balance, let's add icons to #bountysource and support@ (chat bubble and email icon, respectively)</p>",

Furthermore, I think that developers are generally more tech literate, and thus need less explaining and convincing arguments than a your average PM/PR/.../CEO company person would.</p>\n\n<p>About the logo not being present in the <code>h2</code> tag, I don't think it has such a heavy impact and re-displaying it would make the design look repetitive (or un-DRY, as you prefer) . As for the weighing scales theme, I really like where you are going with the idea and I'll be looking forward to see what comes out of it. Prolific wishes! =)</p>",

It does not refer to the code, the projects or the community.</p>\n\n<p>It comes from:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>bounty = cash reward</li>\n<li>source = source code, open source</li>\n</ul><p>\"bountysource\" can be seen as a verb with the following meanings:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>to fund open source projects</li>\n<li>to make money by fixing issues and developing new features in open source projects</li>\n</ol><p>Example of use: I want to bountysource an issue in JSHint.</p>\n\n<p>This process does evoke the \"bounty hunters\" of <a href=\"http://westernfictionreview.blogspot.fr/2009/11/bounty-hunter-series.html\">Westerns</a> (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett\">Star Wars</a>).<br>\nThe Western theme is actually used on <a href=\"http://www.codebounty.co/\">the website of a competing service</a>, and should not be used for the new design.</p>\n\n<p>What makes Bountysource different is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the deep integration with all external issue tracking systems, not limited to GitHub</li>\n<li>rewards in amounts that allow developers to earn a living, not just tipping</li>\n<li>crowd-funding: small amounts of multiple sponsors add up quickly</li>\n</ul><p>From a legal point of view, Bountysource pays developers for their work as contractors, who are responsible for any applicable taxes.</p>\n\n<p>The reward may be used to fund other projects, but the new design should not highlight this aspect of the service.<br>\nThe focus is to help developers to pay their rent.</p>",

I'll join the channel in the morning in your time zone.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to discuss what \"Bountysource\" evokes to you as the founding team.</p>\n\n<p>For me, the first idea that came to my mind was the \"bounty hunter\", evoking Westerns and the Far West. However, I think that drawing inspiration from a male-dominated (and somewhat brutal) society would not present the service in a good light.</p>\n\n<p>I then found out that <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bounty\">\"bounty\" comes from \"bonté\" which means \"goodness\" in French</a>. That might be a better start than the idea of \"reward\" associated with the \"bounty hunter\", and more in line with the roundness in your new logo and the \"bright\" and \"colorful\" adjectives that you choose to describe the new design.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I now realize that I only perceived the second part of your brand \"source\" in the context of technology and software code, as in \"open source\", as a concept of origin. But associated with \"bounty\"/\"goodness\", an association with water now springs to my mind as well.</p>",
